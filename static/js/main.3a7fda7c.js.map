This problem does not impact ASAP because Safari 6.0 supports\n\t// mutation observers, so that implementation is used instead.\n\t// However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around\n\t// is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.\n\t\n\t// `setTimeout` does not call the passed callback if the delay is less than\n\t// approximately 7 in web workers in Firefox 8 through 18, and sometimes not\n\t// even then.\n\t\n\tfunction makeRequestCallFromTimer(callback) {\n\t    return function requestCall() {\n\t        // We dispatch a timeout with a specified delay of 0 for engines that\n\t        // can reliably accommodate that request. This will usually be snapped\n\t        // to a 4 milisecond delay, but once we're flushing, there's no delay\n\t        // between events.\n\t        var timeoutHandle = setTimeout(handleTimer, 0);\n\t        // However, since this timer gets frequently dropped in Firefox\n\t        // workers, we enlist an interval handle that will try to fire\n\t        // an event 20 times per second until it succeeds.\n\t        var intervalHandle = setInterval(handleTimer, 50);\n\t\n\t        function handleTimer() {\n\t            // Whichever timer succeeds will cancel both timers and\n\t            // execute the callback.\n\t            clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);\n\t            clearInterval(intervalHandle);\n\t            callback();\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t}\n\t\n\t// This is for `asap.js` only.\n\t// Its name will be periodically randomized to break any code that depends on\n\t// its existence.\n\trawAsap.makeRequestCallFromTimer = makeRequestCallFromTimer;\n\t\n\t// ASAP was originally a nextTick shim included in Q. This was factored out\n\t// into this ASAP package. It was later adapted to RSVP which made further\n\t// amendments. These decisions, particularly to marginalize MessageChannel and\n\t// to capture the MutationObserver implementation in a closure, were integrated\n\t// back into ASAP proper.\n\t// https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/blob/cddf7232546a9cf858524b75cde6f9edf72620a7/lib/rsvp/asap.js\n\t\n\t/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(exports, (function() { return this; }())))\n\n/***/ },\n/* 394 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\texports.OnClickTooltip = undefined;\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(7);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDom = __webpack_require__(28);\n\t\n\tvar _positionCalc = __webpack_require__(94);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?
